# Indian Agriculture Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on the Indian Agriculture dataset from the National Data and Analytics Platform (NITI Aayog). It aggregates crop production data and visualizes the results using tables and bar charts. 

The table component displays the crop with the maximum and minimum production for each year from 1950 to 2020. The bar chart component visualizes the average yield of each crop over the years.

## Features

- Table displaying the crop with maximum and minimum production for each year (1950-2020).
- Bar chart visualizing the average yield of each crop between 1950-2020.
- Data is processed using TypeScript, Mantine for the table, and Apache ECharts for the bar chart.
- Missing values in the dataset are treated as 0.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `yarn dev` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage  

- The page will display:
  1. **A table** showing the crop with the maximum and minimum production for each year.
  2. **A bar chart** visualizing the average yield of each crop over the years.
